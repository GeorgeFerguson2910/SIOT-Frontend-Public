query thingy

put any images in assets
api contains urls for you server 
index.css is where all global styles are kept
.module.css files are where local styles are kept for pages and components
almost all stuff in pages should be components and if you are going to use something multiple times make a component for it 
hooks are functions with no visual aspects that you call in components to keep the components small.
