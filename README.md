# Frontend

The SIoT frontend is a React-based dashboard designed to visualise real-time and historical data streams from the Black Bull Biochar plant. It provides interactive charts, live system status, fault alerts, and configurable filters for exploring plant behaviour over time. The UI mirrors the look and structure of the production monitoring system, making it suitable for both demonstration and future deployment.
